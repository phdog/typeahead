This is an implementation of basic Typeahead built using:

- [React & ReactDOM](http://facebook.github.io/react/) 15.4.2
- [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) 3.6.0
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) 2.2.1

It is adapted from the [redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

Read more about it in my blog post: http://jaysoo.ca/2015/09/26/typed-react-and-redux/

## Getting Started

## Running development server
